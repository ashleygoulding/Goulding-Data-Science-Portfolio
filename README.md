## Tidy Data Project

#### The Problem

Raw data is often messy, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze. In this project, the dataset from Rally's Mutant Moneyball article contained values that were poorly formatted, contained unnecessary characters, and were spread across multiple columns in an untidy structure. Without proper organization, drawing meaningful insights and creating visualizations was challenging.

#### The Solution

To solve this, I applied Tidy Data Principles to clean, transform, and restructure the dataset. Key steps included:
- Cleaning the data: Removing unwanted characters, handling missing values, and converting data types for consistency.
- Reshaping the dataset: Using `pd.melt()` to convert wide-format data into a long, tidy format.
- Summarizing insights: Creating pivot tables with `pd.pivot()` to analyze trends by source and decade.
- Visualizing key findings: Generating charts to highlight patterns and trends effectively.

### How this Complements My Portfolio

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world data: Cleaning and structuring datasets efficiently.
- Apply Python data science libraries: Using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
- Follow best practices in data analysis: Ensuring reproducibility, clarity, and efficiency in code.
- Tell a story with data: Visualizing key insights to make complex information more understandable.
