# Goulding-Data-Science-Portfolio

## Overview:

In this portfolio, youâ€™ll find a variety of projects that showcase my skills in Python and machine learning. From building machine learning models to creating interactive data visualizations, each project illustrates my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights.

## Organization:

A summary of all projects can be seen below:

-    Penguin Filter Hub
-    Mutant Moneyball Cleaning and Analysis

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Penguin Filter Hub

#### The Problem

Exploring large datasets can be overwhelming, especially when users need to filter and analyze specific subsets of data. The penguin dataset includes multiple attributes such as species, body mass, flipper length, and island location. Without an interactive interface, identifying trends and making meaningful observations is challenging.

#### The Solution

To address this, I built an interactive Streamlit web app that allows users to filter and explore the dataset effortlessly. Key steps included:
- *Building a user-friendly UI*: Using Streamlit widgets (`slider`, `selectbox`) to enable real-time filtering.
- *Filtering the dataset dynamically*: Implementing interactive filters for species, island, body mass, and flipper length.
- *Displaying real-time results*: Using `st.dataframe()` to update and show filtered data instantly.
- *Enhancing usability*: Providing a clean interface for intuitive exploration of penguin characteristics.

#### How This Complements My Portfolio

This project showcases my ability to:
- *Develop interactive data applications*: Creating real-time filtering tools using Streamlit.
- *Work with structured datasets*: Loading and presenting data effectively with pandas.
- *Enhance user experience*: Designing an intuitive UI that allows seamless data exploration.
- *Build functional, interactive tools*: Enabling users to analyze and visualize data without needing coding expertise.

## Mutant Moneyball Cleaning and Analysis

[Click here!](https://github.com/ashleygoulding/Goulding-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TidyData-Project/TidyData.ipynb)

#### The Problem

Raw data is often messy, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze. In this project, the dataset from Rally's Mutant Moneyball article contained values that were poorly formatted, contained unnecessary characters, and were spread across multiple columns in an untidy structure. Without proper organization, drawing meaningful insights and creating visualizations was challenging.

#### The Solution

To solve this, I applied Tidy Data Principles to clean, transform, and restructure the dataset. Key steps included:
- *Cleaning the data*: Removing unwanted characters, handling missing values, and converting data types for consistency.
- *Reshaping the dataset*: Using `pd.melt()` to convert wide-format data into a long, tidy format.
- *Summarizing insights*: Creating pivot tables with `pd.pivot()` to analyze trends by source and decade.
- *Visualizing key findings*: Generating charts to highlight patterns and trends effectively.
