# 📊 Tidy Data Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Tidy Data Principles** to transform and analyze a dataset, ensuring that:
1. 📌 Each variable forms a column.
2. 📌 Each observation forms a row.
3. 📌 Each type of observational unit forms its own table.

By following these principles, we make data manipulation, visualization, and analysis more efficient. The project includes data cleaning, restructuring, and visualization using **pandas** and **matplotlib**.

## ⚙️ Instructions
### 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
# 🚀 Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open TidyData.ipynb.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:

- ✨ Clean and preprocess the data.
- 🔄 Reshape the dataset into a tidy format.
- 📊 Generate visualizations to explore trends
