# 📊 Tidy Data Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Tidy Data Principles** to transform and analyze a dataset, ensuring that:
1. 📌 Each variable forms a column.
2. 📌 Each observation forms a row.
3. 📌 Each type of observational unit forms its own table.

By following these principles, we make data manipulation, visualization, and analysis more efficient. The project includes data cleaning, restructuring, and visualization using **pandas** and **matplotlib**.
