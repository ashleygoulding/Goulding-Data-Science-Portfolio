# ðŸŒŸ Supervised Machine Learning Explorer

An interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to explore, train, and evaluate supervised machine learning models â€” without writing any code!

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This application is designed to make machine learning approachable for beginners and useful for practitioners. Users can upload a dataset, select their target and feature columns, choose a classification algorithm, tune its hyperparameters, and view performance metrics and visualizations â€” all within a clean, intuitive interface.

If no dataset is uploaded, the app defaults to the popular Iris dataset.
