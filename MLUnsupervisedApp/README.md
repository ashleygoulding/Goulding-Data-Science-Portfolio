# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Explorer

A user-friendly Streamlit app for exploring **unsupervised machine learning** techniques—**K-Means Clustering**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**—with rich visualizations and interactive controls.

## 📌 Project Overview

This app helps users explore patterns and structures in datasets without predefined labels. Users can:

- Upload their own CSV datasets or select sample data.
- Choose features for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Run **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**, with visualizations like:
  - Elbow plots
  - Silhouette plots
  - Dendrograms
- Perform **PCA**, with explained variance ratios, 2D projections, and interactive biplots.

It’s ideal for students, analysts, or anyone interested in unsupervised learning without needing to write code.
